/**
 * Lanternfish reproduction works in cycles, so this is used to our advantage in
 * this implementation.
 *
 * <p>
 * Instead of representing each individual fish, we group how many fish has X
 * days left to reproduce. We use a circular index to go through the list, the
 * current element representing those fish with age 0, that is, those who will
 * reproduce today.
 *
 * <p>
 * Because newborn fish take longer to reproduce, they have to be handled
 * separately. Because they take one full cycle plus two days to reproduce for
 * the first time, they cannot be added to the list immediately. Instead, two
 * separate integers are used. One stores those fish with age 8, the other with
 * age 7. Fish with age 6 can be added to those who have just reproduced,
 * <i>after</i> they do. This could be generalized by using a queue, which would
 * work for any combination of normal spawn rate and newborn spawn rate, but as
 * these values are constant, it is not really necessary in this case.
 *
 * <p>
 * The only disadvantage with this approach is that we cannot see a separate
 * list of fish in the order they were born with their respective "time to
 * reproduce", which was possible with the naive approach.
